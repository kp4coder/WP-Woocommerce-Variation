# WP-Woocommerce-Variation
This WooCommerce variation plugin changes the product image based on the selected variation. To ensure proper display, all images must be uploaded in the same dimensions (height and width), with a transparent background. Additionally, make sure to upload the specific images that you want to use for each variation.
